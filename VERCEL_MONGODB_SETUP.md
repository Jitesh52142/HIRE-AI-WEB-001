# 🔧 Complete MongoDB Setup for Vercel Deployment

## 🚨 Problem
**You cannot login or signup because:**
- ❌ MongoDB database is not connected to Vercel
- ❌ `MONGO_URI` environment variable is not set
- ❌ App tries to connect to database but fails

**Result:** "Login service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

## ✅ Solution (10 Minutes Setup)

Follow these steps exactly to fix the database connection:

---

## STEP 1: Create Free MongoDB Atlas Database (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Sign Up for MongoDB Atlas
```
🌐 Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
```

- Click **"Try Free"**
- Sign up with Google/Email
- **It's 100% FREE** - no credit card needed

### 1.2 Create a Cluster
1. After signup, click **"Build a Database"**
2. Choose **"M0 - FREE"** tier (should be pre-selected)
3. Provider: **AWS** (recommended)
4. Region: Choose closest to you
5. Cluster Name: `hire-ai-cluster` (or keep default)
6. Click **"Create"** (takes 1-3 minutes)

### 1.3 Create Database User
1. You'll see **"Security Quickstart"**
2. Authentication Method: **Username and Password**
3. Username: `hire_ai_admin`
4. Password: Click **"Autogenerate Secure Password"** (save this!)
   - Or create your own: `HireAI2025!Secure`
5. ✅ **SAVE THIS PASSWORD** - you'll need it!
6. Click **"Create User"**

### 1.4 Whitelist IP Address (Important!)
1. Next screen: **"Where would you like to connect from?"**
2. Click **"Add My Current IP Address"** (adds your current IP)
3. **ALSO** click **"Add a Different IP Address"**
4. IP Address: `0.0.0.0/0`
5. Description: `Vercel Deployment (All IPs)`
6. Click **"Add Entry"**
7. Click **"Finish and Close"**

**Why 0.0.0.0/0?** Vercel uses dynamic IPs, so we need to allow all IPs for serverless functions.

---

## STEP 2: Get MongoDB Connection String (2 minutes)

### 2.1 Navigate to Connect
1. On MongoDB Atlas dashboard, find your cluster
2. Click **"Connect"** button

### 2.2 Choose Connection Method
1. Select **"Connect your application"**
2. Driver: **Python**
3. Version: **3.12 or later** (or any recent version)

### 2.3 Copy Connection String
You'll see something like:
```
mongodb+srv://hire_ai_admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 2.4 Format Your Connection String
Replace two things:
1. Replace `<password>` with your actual password from Step 1.3
2. Add `/hire_ai` before the `?` to specify database name

**Before:**
```
mongodb+srv://hire_ai_admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**After (Example):**
```
mongodb+srv://hire_ai_admin:HireAI2025!Secure@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/hire_ai?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

✅ **SAVE THIS FORMATTED STRING** - you'll add it to Vercel!

---

## STEP 3: Add MongoDB URI to Vercel (2 minutes)

### 3.1 Open Vercel Dashboard
```
🌐 Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

### 3.2 Select Your Project
- Find and click: **hire-ai-web-001**

### 3.3 Navigate to Environment Variables
1. Click **"Settings"** tab (top menu)
2. Click **"Environment Variables"** (left sidebar)

### 3.4 Add MONGO_URI Variable
1. Click **"Add New"** button
2. Fill in:
   ```
   Name: MONGO_URI
   Value: mongodb+srv://hire_ai_admin:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/hire_ai?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
   ⚠️ **Paste your actual connection string from Step 2.4!**

3. Environment: Check **ALL THREE**
   - ✓ Production
   - ✓ Preview  
   - ✓ Development

4. Click **"Save"**

### 3.5 Add Other Required Variables
Add these 4 more variables the same way:

**Variable 2: SECRET_KEY**
```
Name: SECRET_KEY
Value: hire-ai-production-secret-key-2025-very-secure-change-this
Environments: ✓ All three
```

**Variable 3: ADMIN_EMAIL**
```
Name: ADMIN_EMAIL
Value: admin@hireai.com
Environments: ✓ All three
```

**Variable 4: ADMIN_PASSWORD**
```
Name: ADMIN_PASSWORD
Value: admin123
Environments: ✓ All three
```

**Variable 5: N8N_WEBHOOK_URL** (Optional)
```
Name: N8N_WEBHOOK_URL
Value: https://n8n.srv812138.hstgr.cloud/webhook/hireai
Environments: ✓ All three
```

---

## STEP 4: Redeploy Your Application (1 minute)

### 4.1 Trigger Redeploy
1. In Vercel dashboard, click **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the latest deployment (top of list)
3. Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. Confirm: Click **"Redeploy"** in the popup

### 4.2 Wait for Deployment
- Status will show "Building..." then "Ready"
- Takes about 1-2 minutes
- ✅ Wait until status is **"Ready"** (green checkmark)

---

## STEP 5: Test Your Application (2 minutes)

### 5.1 Test Database Connection
```
🌐 Visit: https://hire-ai-web-001.vercel.app/test
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "test_successful",
  "mongodb": "connected",
  "mongodb_details": {
    "ping": "success",
    "user_count": 0
  }
}
```

✅ If you see `"mongodb": "connected"` - SUCCESS!

### 5.2 Create Admin User
```
🌐 Visit: https://hire-ai-web-001.vercel.app/auth/create-admin
```

**Expected:** "Admin user created successfully!"

### 5.3 Test Login
```
🌐 Visit: https://hire-ai-web-001.vercel.app/auth/login
```

**Login with:**
- Email: `admin@hireai.com`
- Password: `admin123`

✅ Should redirect to homepage with "Login successful!" message

### 5.4 Test Registration
```
🌐 Visit: https://hire-ai-web-001.vercel.app/auth/register
```

- Create your own account
- Should see "Account created successfully!"
- Should be able to login with new account

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Login service temporarily unavailable"
**Cause:** MONGO_URI not set or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Verify MONGO_URI is added in Vercel
2. Check connection string format
3. Ensure password doesn't have special characters like `<`, `>`, `@`
4. Redeploy after adding variable

### Issue: "Connection timeout"
**Cause:** IP not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas

**Fix:**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas → Network Access
2. Verify 0.0.0.0/0 is in the list
3. Status should be "Active"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Cause:** Wrong username or password in connection string

**Fix:**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas → Database Access
2. Verify username matches: `hire_ai_admin`
3. If password has special characters, try resetting it
4. Update MONGO_URI with new password
5. Redeploy

### Issue: "Database doesn't exist"
**Cause:** Missing database name in connection string

**Fix:**
Ensure your connection string has `/hire_ai` before `?`:
```
mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/hire_ai?retryWrites=true
                                                      ^^^^^^^^
```

### Issue: Variables not working
**Cause:** Environment not selected or not redeployed

**Fix:**
1. Check all 3 environments are checked for each variable
2. Delete and re-add the variable
3. **Must redeploy** after adding/changing variables

   ```javascript
   {
     "_id": "user@email.com",
     "email": "user@email.com",
     "password": "$2b$12$hashed_password",
     "is_admin": false,
     "created_at": "2025-01-23T12:00:00"
   }
   ```

2. **form_submissions** - Dashboard submissions
3. **contact_queries** - Contact form messages

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Security**: Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` after first login
2. **Backup**: MongoDB Atlas auto-backups on free tier
3. **Monitoring**: Check Atlas dashboard for connection metrics
4. **Scaling**: Upgrade to paid tier when you need more storage
5. **Testing**: Use `/test` endpoint to verify connection anytime

---

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

### Check These:
1. MongoDB Atlas cluster is **Active** (not paused)
2. Vercel deployment is **Ready** (green status)
3. All environment variables spell correctly
4. Connection string has no extra spaces
5. Waited 2-3 minutes after adding variables

### View Logs:
```
Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Latest → Function Logs
```
Look for specific error messages
