Got it üëç ‚Äî I‚Äôll clean up the documentation so no sensitive `.env` values are shown. Instead, I‚Äôll only **describe what needs to be added**, without revealing keys, emails, or passwords.

Here‚Äôs the updated **Hire AI documentation** with the `.env` section anonymized:

# Hire AI

Hire AI is a sophisticated, AI-driven recruitment platform built with Flask, designed to help companies streamline their hiring process. It provides a multi-step form for defining job requirements, automates data submission to a webhook for custom workflows, and displays real-time candidate insights pulled from public Google Sheets.

## Features

* **Multi-Step Form**: A clean, user-friendly form wizard for capturing detailed job descriptions.
* **AI Integration**: Submits data to an n8n webhook to trigger external AI-powered candidate searches.
* **Dynamic Dashboards**: Displays real-time candidate data and hiring history fetched directly from public Google Sheets.
* **Secure Authentication**: User registration and login managed with Flask-Login and Bcrypt.
* **Protected Admin Panel**: An administrative view of all database collections, accessible only to an admin user.
* **Modular Design**: Built with Flask Blueprints for a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* MongoDB Atlas account (free tier is sufficient)
* A public Google Sheet with a specific format for candidate data
* An n8n webhook URL to receive form submissions

## n8n Setup (Basic Overview)

To make the automation work, you need an **n8n workflow** to process incoming form submissions from Hire AI.

1. **Install n8n (local or cloud):**

   * Local:

     ```bash
     npm install n8n -g
     n8n start
     ```
   * Or sign up for **n8n.cloud** (managed hosting).

2. **Create a new workflow in n8n:**

   * Add a **Webhook Node** ‚Üí copy the webhook URL and paste it into your `.env` as `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`.
   * Set **HTTP Method = POST**.

3. **Process the incoming job data:**

   * Connect nodes like:

     * **Webhook (Trigger)** ‚Üí receives form data from Hire AI.
     * **OpenAI / HuggingFace / Function Node** ‚Üí process job descriptions.
     * **Google Sheets Node** ‚Üí store candidate/job data.
     * **Email/Slack Node** ‚Üí notify HR teams.

4. **Activate the workflow:**

   * Save ‚Üí Toggle **Active**.
   * Now, every new job posting from Hire AI will trigger your n8n automation.
